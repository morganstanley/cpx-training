# Expression and Statements

### Definition
* **Expression**: something that needs to be evaluated. 
    * a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions: `1+1`
    * the evaluation of an expression produces a value
* **Statement**: instruction that can be executed
    * assignment: `x = 1`
    * for, while, if, import statements  

**Pick a previous program: go through the code line by line, which is expression and which is statement?**

[Review the use of console: from Level 1 exercise 6](https://github.com/mimiflynn/cpx-training/blob/master/Level%201%20-%20Intro%20to%20CPX/6-temperature/main.py)
```python
import time
from adafruit_circuitplayground.express import cpx

while True:
    print("Temperature C:", cpx.temperature)
    print("Temperature F:", cpx.temperature * 1.8 + 32)
    print((cpx.temperature, cpx.temperature * 1.8 + 32))
    time.sleep(1)

```

```python
# Execute simple statements/expression using console
y = 3.14
x = len("hello")
print(x)
print(y)
```

**What is the difference between statement and expression from using console?**
