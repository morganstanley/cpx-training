# Variables and Types

## Color Variables
[From level 1 exercise 2](https://github.com/mimiflynn/cpx-training/blob/master/Level%201%20-%20Intro%20to%20CPX/2-lights/main.py)

```python
import board
import neopixel

pixels = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 10, brightness=.1)
pixels.fill((0, 0, 0))
pixels.show()


while True:
    pixels[0] = (255, 0, 0)
    pixels[1] = (255, 127, 0)
    pixels[2] = (0, 255, 0)
    pixels[3] = (0, 255, 127)
    pixels[4] = (75, 0, 130)
    pixels[5] = (60, 0, 255)
    pixels[6] = (255, 255, 255)
    pixels[7] = (0, 100, 0)
    pixels[8] = (100, 0, 0)
    pixels[9] = (0, 0, 100)
    pixels.show()
```

What do those numbers mean? How can we make this more readable?

Make a list of color variables by color name.

```python
import board
import neopixel

pixels = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 10, brightness=.1)

# Colors
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
RED = (255, 0, 0)
PINK = (255, 100, 120)
ORANGE = (255, 100, 0)
YELLOW = (255, 255, 0)
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)
CYAN = (0, 255, 255)
PURPLE = (255, 0, 255)
BLUE = (0, 0, 255)
LIGHT_BLUE = (80, 200, 175)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)

pixels.fill(BLACK)

while True:
    pixels[0] = RED
    pixels[1] = ORANGE
    pixels[2] = GREEN
    pixels[3] = CYAN
    pixels[4] = PURPLE
    pixels[5] = BLUE
    pixels[6] = WHITE
    pixels[7] = YELLOW
    pixels[8] = PINK
    pixels[9] = LIGHT_BLUE
    pixels.show()
```

 * a variable is used to store data to be used by the program
 * this data can be a number, a string, a Boolean, a list or some other data type
 * every variable has a name which can consist of letters, numbers, and the underscore character (_). 
 * no other type of characters can be used to create the variable name and the variable may NOT start with a number. 
 * the equal sign = is used to assign a value to a variable. 
 * that assignment can be from a fixed value or taken from another existing variable
 * it can also be used to change the value of a variable from one value to another after the initial assignment is made

## Working with lists

Eventually come to this:

```python
# Learn more https://realpython.com/python-variables/
# and https://realpython.com/python-data-types/
import time

import board
import neopixel

pixels = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 10, brightness=.1)

# Colors
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
RED = (255, 0, 0)
PINK = (255, 100, 120)
ORANGE = (255, 100, 0)
YELLOW = (255, 255, 0)
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)
CYAN = (0, 255, 255)
PURPLE = (255, 0, 255)
BLUE = (0, 0, 255)
LIGHT_BLUE = (80, 200, 175)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)

pixels = pixels
pixels.fill(BLACK)
pixels.show()

while True:
    for i in range(len(pixels)):
        pixels[i] = RED
        time.sleep(.05)
    time.sleep(1)

    for i in range(len(pixels)):
        pixels[i] = GREEN
        time.sleep(.05)
    time.sleep(1)
```

How can we streamline this so that we don't have to enter a color for each `for` block?

```python
import time

import board
import neopixel

pixels = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 10, brightness=.1)

# Colors
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
RED = (255, 0, 0)
PINK = (255, 100, 120)
ORANGE = (255, 100, 0)
YELLOW = (255, 255, 0)
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)
CYAN = (0, 255, 255)
PURPLE = (255, 0, 255)
BLUE = (0, 0, 255)
LIGHT_BLUE = (80, 200, 175)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)

colors = [
    PINK,
    RED,
    ORANGE,
    YELLOW, 
    GREEN, 
    CYAN, 
    PURPLE, 
    BLUE, 
    LIGHT_BLUE, 
    WHITE
]

pixels.fill(BLACK)
pixels.show()

while True:
    for i in range(len(pixels)):
        pixels[i] = colors[i]
        time.sleep(.05)
    time.sleep(1)

```
