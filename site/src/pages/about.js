          <h2>What is Morgan Stanley Makerspace</h2>
          <p>
            An employee designed and run program bringing one-off STEM-based
            interactive workshops to children and teens.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our most common workshop marries Python programming and hardware
            with the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express (CPX), a beginner
            friendly microcontroller that provides fast feedback necessary for
            new programmers.
          </p>
          <p>
            We launched our Morgan Stanley Makerspace program with the hope that
            it would - in the long-term - drive greater digital literacy amongst
            the young people we'd engage. For as long as the digital industry
            has thrived in the United States, there has been a gap between those
            who have access to technology and those who do not. This digital
            divide is not just access to reliable and affordable internet
            service, but equitable access to fundamental technology education
            required to ensure digital literacy and economic opportunity in our
            ever evolving and increasingly virtual world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the program's launch in 2018, 500+ children and teens have
            participated dozens of different workshops; 50% of participants
            resided in a NYC shelter at the time of participation.

            <p>
              "Children are natural consumers of digital information. However,
              to engage them at a deeper level of understanding of Computer
              science, so that they can evaluate, produce, and critique new
              technology, we needed to get creative. We needed to introduce
              electronics and programming in a highly tangible way early in the
              education. This led us to the combination of two of the best of
              breed technologies: Adafruit's Microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi's
              laptop-computer. Specifically, Raspberry Pi 400 and Adafruit CPX
              (often used by employees to teach their own children to code) - to
              transform these young consumers of technology into
              self-sufficient, digital citizens, who recognize they can be
              creators of technology."

              The MS Makerspace program came into my life at exactly the right
              time. After many years of helping my own children learn robotics
              through extracurricular programs like the First Lego League, I
              wanted to take what I had learned and share it with children who
              might not have otherwise have access. Our MS Makerspace workshops
              have created the perfect opportunity. Teaching kids who stand to
              benefit the most from the right mentorship has been such a
              fulfilling experience. If we continue to leverage the collective
              knowledge of our Technology organization, I believe we can
              continue to make a big difference in kids' lives by inspiring and
              igniting a passion for technology.

              MS Makerspaces embody what it means to Give Back through
              skills-based volunteerism. Organically grown within Technology,
              it's a movement that brings coding to children and young adults
              who might not get regular exposure to Computer Science education.
              Whether we're running a workshop at a school in Jersey City or a
              shelter in the Bronx, there is something magical about watching a
              young person realize that coding is cool, or that they have a gift
              for thinking like a programmer.

          <p>
            Morgan Stanley's STEM Extension program takes our Makerspace
            workshops to the next-level, providing week-on-week sustained
            engagement with cohorts of students across New York, New Jersey, and

            The new initiative leverages physical computing through the
            Raspberry Pi 400 computer and the Adafruit Feather Wing controllers,
            in addition to the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express, to teach the
            fundamentals of computer science education. The end goal? Connect
            students with limited access to computer science education, helping
            them move beyond being a consumer of technology into a
            self-sufficient digital citizen.

          <h2>Why Adafruit Circuit Playground Express?</h2>
          <p>
            Adafruit Industries, the manufacturer of CPX was founded by MIT
            engineering pioneer. Limor "Lady Ada" Fried. We are proud to support
            Adafruit Industries as a 100% women-owned top ranked manufacturing
            company in the US. When establishing the company, Limor's goal was
            to create the best place online for learning electronics and making
            the best designed products for makers of all ages and skill-levels.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            The Adafruit CPX is just that - an all-in-one circuit design board
            packed full of features such as a processor, sensors, mini-speakers,
            LED lights, and a USB port for streamlined software integration and
            a fast feedback loop. The circuit is also multi-device compatible
            which means it runs successfully across almost any of your favorite
            operating systems including Windows, Mac, Chromebook and Linux.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once your CPX device is connected to a computer, you can begin
            programming interactive projects in a matter of minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The CPX also supports user choice in the programming environment and
            language they wish to code. Students can implement programs using
            Python, Microsoft Make Code, C/C++ and JavaScript.

          <h2>Why Raspberry Pi?</h2>
          <p>
            The Raspberry Pi foundation is a UK-based charity that works to put
            the power of computing and digital making into the hands of people
            all over the world. The nonprofit was born from a desire to enough
            more hands-on computer education to students and teachers alike.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through their innovative Raspberry Pi devices, a single-board
            computer, students can engage deeply with computer science education
            at a low cost. Unlike a traditional computer, which hides its inner
            working, a standard Raspberry Pi has all it's components, ports, and
            features out on display.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            The Raspberry Pi also encourages students to think creatively about
            tasks in a complex, non-linear way.
