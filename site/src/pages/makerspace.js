            <section className="column">
              <p>
                In order to fill the tech- and science-focused roles of the
                future, technologists nationwide should focus on providing youth
                from underserved communities the resources to promote computer
                science advocacy now.
              </p>
              <p>
                Students from underprivileged backgrounds are 8 to 10 times more
                likely to pursue college degrees in computer science if they
                have taken AP computer science in high school. We can project
                that these odds will only increase if studentds are given even
                earlier exposure to software and hardware technologies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through this Maker workshop, technologists who are passionate
                about bridging this gap will develop a blueprint that can be
                leveraged to facilitate tech exploration workshops for
                underserved youth in their communities. Marrying knowledge of
                Python programming and Adafruit Circuit Playground Express
                devices, their students will be empowered to become makers of
                technology.
