## Lesson 1: Rainbow Glow
Let’s light up the ImagiCharm with a glowing rainbow! Follow the steps below to learn how to make the rainbow glow.

### Step 1: Start with a Blank Canvas
```python
# Create a blank canvas
pixels.clear()
```

- **What This Does**: Clears the screen so nothing is left from before.
- Try running just this line. What happens on the ImagiCharm?

### Step 2: Turn on the First Pixel
Let’s start by turning on the top-left pixel with a bright red color.

```python
# Turn on the first pixel
pixels[0][0] = (255, 0, 0)  # Red
```

- **Explanation**:
  - **`pixels[0][0]`**: This picks the first pixel in the top-left corner.
  - **`(255, 0, 0)`**: This means the pixel will glow red (255 for red, 0 for green and blue).
- **Challenge**: Can you change this to green? (Hint: Set the second number to 255.)

### Step 3: Add More Colors
Now, let’s turn on more pixels to make a rainbow on the first row.

```python
# Turn on the pixels for a rainbow!
pixels[0][1] = (255, 165, 0)     # Orange
pixels[0][2] = (255, 255, 0)     # Yellow
pixels[0][3] = (0, 255, 0)       # Green
pixels[0][4] = (0, 0, 255)       # Blue
pixels[0][5] = (75, 0, 130)      # Indigo
pixels[0][6] = (238, 130, 238)   # Violet
```

- **Explanation**:
  - Each pixel in the row is assigned a color.
  - The colors of the rainbow are added one by one, using `(red, green, blue)` values.
- **Activity**: Try changing one of the colors. What happens if you mix red and blue?

### Step 4: Show the Rainbow
Finally, let’s display the rainbow on the ImagiCharm.

```python
# Show the rainbow on the ImagiCharm!
pixels.show()
```

- **What This Does**: Lights up all the pixels we set!

### Full Code
Here’s the complete code to make your glowing rainbow:

```python
# Create a blank canvas
pixels.clear()

# Turn on the pixels for a rainbow!
pixels[0][0] = (255, 0, 0)       # Red
pixels[0][1] = (255, 165, 0)     # Orange
pixels[0][2] = (255, 255, 0)     # Yellow
pixels[0][3] = (0, 255, 0)       # Green
pixels[0][4] = (0, 0, 255)       # Blue
pixels[0][5] = (75, 0, 130)      # Indigo
pixels[0][6] = (238, 130, 238)   # Violet

# Show the rainbow on the ImagiCharm!
pixels.show()
```

### Explore More
- Change the brightness of the pixels.
  *(Hint: Use `pixels.brightness = 0.5` before the `pixels.show()` line.)*
- Create a second row of rainbow colors. What patterns can you make?

## Lesson 2: Pattern Drawing
Learn how to draw custom patterns and shapes on your ImagiCharm using nested loops and creative logic.

### Solution for Rainbow Glow
```python
# Activity 1: Rainbow Glow Animation
import time
import sys
colors = [
    (255, 0, 0),   # Red
    (255, 127, 0), # Orange
    (255, 255, 0), # Yellow
    (0, 255, 0),   # Green
    (0, 0, 255),   # Blue
    (75, 0, 130),  # Indigo
    (148, 0, 211)  # Violet
]
for color in colors:
    sys.stdout.write(f"\rRainbow pixel: {color}")
    sys.stdout.flush()
    time.sleep(0.5)
print("\nRainbow animation complete!")
```

### Solution for Pattern Drawing
```python
pattern = [
    [1,0,1,0,1],
    [0,1,0,1,0],
    [1,0,1,0,1],
    [0,1,0,1,0],
    [1,0,1,0,1]
]
for row in pattern:
    print(' '.join(str(pixel) for pixel in row))
print("Pattern drawn!")
```
