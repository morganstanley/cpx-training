## Multi-week Programs

### [Introduction to MakeCode](/exercises/en-US/makecode/intro)

_Grades 5-7_
Multi-week course with Circuit Playground Express and MakeCode. Best for beginners of ages 9-15, this graphical block based coding format translates to Javascript for a more comprehensive coding experience.

### [Introduction to CircuitPython](/exercises/en-US/circuitpython)

_Grades 6-9_
Based on the original single day workshop with Circuit Playground Express and CircuitPython. Starts with an overview of how to work with the board's sensors and lights through code and ends with a capstone project of the student's creation.
