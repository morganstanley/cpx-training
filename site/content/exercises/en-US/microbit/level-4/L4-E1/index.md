### Objective

Apply your knowledge to build a creative project.

### Group Projects

Collaborate in small teams to build creative and functional micro:bit systems. Below are curated multi-micro:bit or sensor-rich group projects with official links.

---

#### 1. Digital Pet Game

Create a virtual pet that displays needs and emotions. Use buttons to feed/play and keep the pet happy.

ðŸ”— [Digital Pet Project â€“ MakeCode Project](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/digital-pet)

**Skills Used:**

- Variables
- Button interactions
- LED icons and loops

---

#### 2. Reaction Timer (Multiplayer)

Compete to test reaction speeds! Use two micro:bits with radio to start and stop the timer.

ðŸ”— [Reaction Time Game â€“ MakeCode Project](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/reaction-time)

**Skills Used:**

- Conditional logic
- Timing events
- Radio communication (multi-device)

---

#### 3. Motion-Triggered Alarm System

Create an anti-theft or locker alarm system that triggers when motion is detected.

ðŸ”— [MakeCode Alarm Project](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/alarm)

**Skills Used:**

- Accelerometer sensor
- Sound/LED feedback
- Conditional loops

---

#### 4. Message Broadcasting System (Walkie-Talkie Style)

Send text messages between micro:bits using radio. Display them on the LED grid like a mini pager.

ðŸ”— [Radio Messaging (Text Chat) â€“ MakeCode Project](https://learn.microblocks.fun/en/activities/mb-walkie-talkie-en/index.html)

**Skills Used:**

- `radio.sendString()`
- Event listeners
- LED text scrolling

---

#### 5. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Shake your micro:bit to play Rock, Paper, or Scissors and compete with friends!

ðŸ”— [Rock Paper Scissors â€“ MakeCode Project](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/rock-paper-scissors)
ðŸ”— [Microbit.org Guide](https://microbit.org/projects/make-it-code-it/rock-paper-scissors/)

**Skills Used:**

- Random numbers
- Shake gesture detection
- Icon display

### Group Collaboration Tips

- Assign roles: programmer, tester, documenter, presenter
- Plan using pseudocode or flowcharts
- Test each component before combining
- Present: show the final project and explain contributions
