Now let's use the buttons on the device to turn individual LEDs on and off. We use the `cp.button_a` and `cp.button_b` properties to determine if the given button is being pressed down:

```python
from adafruit_circuitplayground import cp

while True:
    if cp.button_a:
        cp.pixels[0] = (255, 255, 255)
    elif cp.button_b:
        cp.pixels[1] = (255, 255, 255)
```

### Challenge Problem 1

Modify the code above so that only one pixel is on at a time. In other words, if multiple buttons are pressed in a sequence, only the most recent pixel stays on.

_Hint: consider using `cp.pixels.fill`_

### Challenge Problem 2

Now modify the code so that each pixel is on only as long as the user holds down the button.
