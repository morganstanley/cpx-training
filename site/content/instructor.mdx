## Mission &amp; Philosophy

Train the trainer sessions are the starting point for volunteers of all backgrounds
to gather in a space and learn what goes into a Morgan Stanley Makerspace session.
There will be a presentation of the curriculum, the opportunity to gain some hands
on experience with the CPX device, and a discussion of the philosphy with which we
run our makerspaces.

The Morgan Stanley Makerspaces are designed to introduce participants to
coding and making with the Adafruit CPX device as a starting platform.

The philosophy of Makerspace is one of discovery, experimentation and
passion. The curriculum is not used as a test or a required standard to be
achieved, but a jumping off point. It introduces the students to the
features of the device in order to inspire creativity. An instructor's role
is to facilitate and guide that creativity to create with the CPX what the
student imagines.

We hope that by the end of the session, the participants will have
cultivated a desire in the students to delve deeper and learn more about
whichever aspect of technology inspired them.

## Notes from Experienced Instructors

### General Guidance

- Give students time and space to explore what catches their interest in each
  exercise.
- Learn enough on your own to anticipate the student's needs and prompt or
  suggest when needed.
- Feel free to make mistakes in front of them and say that you don't know
  something. Let them know you are learning too. Show them how to research and
  teach themselves the way we do as professionals.
- When you don't know something, work through it out loud with the group. The
  troubleshooting process is a valuable skill to learn even if they don't take
  to coding.
- If your group shows an interest in a certain aspect of a lession (color
  theory, music notes, etc), dive into it! This is what we are hoping for!
  Don't stress about the number of lessons. This moment is the most valuable
  learning moment.
- If a student is overwhelmed let them know its okay and to take quiet time
  for themselves.
- If the lessons seem easy to your group, add challenges and encourage
  creativity.

### Remote Lessons

- Give students quiet time to work through the code. Check in by name in a
  rotating fashion.
- Share your screen and demonstrate examples with your webcam if possible.
- Encourage students to keep their camera on and mics unmuted to foster
  troubleshooting when needed and natural conversation.
  -Encourage students to share their screen when troubleshooting.
