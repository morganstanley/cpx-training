## What is Morgan Stanley Makerspace

An employee designed and run program bringing one-off STEM-based interactive workshops
to children and teens.

Our most common workshop marries Python programming and hardware
with the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express (CPX), a beginner
friendly microcontroller that provides fast feedback necessary for
new programmers.

We launched our Morgan Stanley Makerspace program with the hope that
it would - in the long-term - drive greater digital literacy amongst
the young people we'd engage. For as long as the digital industry
has thrived in the United States, there has been a gap between those
who have access to technology and those who do not. This digital
divide is not just access to reliable and affordable internet
service, but equitable access to fundamental technology education
required to ensure digital literacy and economic opportunity in our
ever evolving and increasingly virtual world.

Since the program's launch in 2018, 500+ children and teens have
participated dozens of different workshops; 50% of participants
resided in a NYC shelter at the time of participation.

### Mission

<blockquote>

    Our DNA, our culture and our history are rooted in serving our
    clients.

<cite>James Gorman</cite>
</blockquote>

The Morgan Stanley Makerspace works towards two of the Firm's core
values.

<h3>Give Back</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Be generous with your expertise, your time, your money.</li>
  <li>Invest in the future of our communities and our Firm.</li>
  <li>Mentor our next generation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Testimonials</h3>
<blockquote>
  "Children are natural consumers of digital information. However, to engage
  them at a deeper level of understanding of Computer science, so that they can
  evaluate, produce, and critique new technology, we needed to get creative. We
  needed to introduce electronics and programming in a highly tangible way early
  in the education. This led us to the combination of two of the best of breed
  technologies: Adafruit's Microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi's laptop-computer.
  Specifically, Raspberry Pi 400 and Adafruit CPX (often used by employees to
  teach their own children to code) - to transform these young consumers of
  technology into self-sufficient, digital citizens, who recognize they can be
  creators of technology."
  <cite>Kumar Vadaparty</cite>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  The MS Makerspace program came into my life at exactly the right time. After
  many years of helping my own children learn robotics through extracurricular
  programs like the First Lego League, I wanted to take what I had learned and
  share it with children who might not have otherwise have access. Our MS
  Makerspace workshops have created the perfect opportunity. Teaching kids who
  stand to benefit the most from the right mentorship has been such a fulfilling
  experience. If we continue to leverage the collective knowledge of our
  Technology organization, I believe we can continue to make a big difference in
  kids' lives by inspiring and igniting a passion for technology.

<blockquote>
  MS Makerspaces embody what it means to Give Back through skills-based
  volunteerism. Organically grown within Technology, it's a movement that brings
  coding to children and young adults who might not get regular exposure to
  Computer Science education. Whether we're running a workshop at a school in
  Jersey City or a shelter in the Bronx, there is something magical about
  watching a young person realize that coding is cool, or that they have a gift
  for thinking like a programmer.

<h2>What is Morgan Stanley STEM Extension?</h2>
Morgan Stanley's STEM Extension program takes our Makerspace workshops to the next-level,
providing week-on-week sustained engagement with cohorts of students across New York,
New Jersey, and Maryland.

The new initiative leverages physical computing through the
Raspberry Pi 400 computer and the Adafruit Feather Wing controllers,
in addition to the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express, to teach the
fundamentals of computer science education. The end goal? Connect
students with limited access to computer science education, helping
them move beyond being a consumer of technology into a
self-sufficient digital citizen.

<h2>Why Adafruit Circuit Playground Express?</h2>

Adafruit Industries, the manufacturer of CPX was founded by MIT
engineering pioneer. Limor "Lady Ada" Fried. We are proud to support
Adafruit Industries as a 100% women-owned top ranked manufacturing
company in the US. When establishing the company, Limor's goal was
to create the best place online for learning electronics and making
the best designed products for makers of all ages and skill-levels.{' '}

The Adafruit CPX is just that - an all-in-one circuit design board
packed full of features such as a processor, sensors, mini-speakers,
LED lights, and a USB port for streamlined software integration and
a fast feedback loop. The circuit is also multi-device compatible
which means it runs successfully across almost any of your favorite
operating systems including Windows, Mac, Chromebook and Linux.

Once your CPX device is connected to a computer, you can begin
programming interactive projects in a matter of minutes.

The CPX also supports user choice in the programming environment and
language they wish to code. Students can implement programs using
Python, Microsoft Make Code, C/C++ and JavaScript.

<h2>Why Raspberry Pi?</h2>

The Raspberry Pi foundation is a UK-based charity that works to put
the power of computing and digital making into the hands of people
all over the world. The nonprofit was born from a desire to enough
more hands-on computer education to students and teachers alike.

Through their innovative Raspberry Pi devices, a single-board
computer, students can engage deeply with computer science education
at a low cost. Unlike a traditional computer, which hides its inner
working, a standard Raspberry Pi has all it's components, ports, and
features out on display.
The Raspberry Pi also encourages students to think creatively about
tasks in a complex, non-linear way.
